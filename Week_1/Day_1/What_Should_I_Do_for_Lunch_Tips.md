### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = function (hungry, availableTime) {
  if (!hungry) {
    console.log("Continue the work");
  } else if (availableTime < 20) {
    console.log(
      "Pick something up and eat in back in the Lab or in the Kitchen"
    );
  } else if (availableTime >= 20 && availableTime < 30) {
    console.log("You deserve a break and could try a place in Gastown");
  } else {
    console.log(
      "This is a bootcamp after all and you should probably reconsider"
    );
  }
};
```
